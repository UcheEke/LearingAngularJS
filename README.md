My examples for Udemy Course "Learn and Understand AngularJS" by Anthony P Alicea

This has to be one of the best courses I have taken so far on Udemy. Not only does Anthony use clear illustrations of how to employ AngularJS, 
but he also provides in depth explanations of the mechanics of Angular, leading to a fuller understanding of the subject.

This repo contains my commented work through his examples. I would recommend this course to anyone who is interested in learning
and understanding AngularJS.
